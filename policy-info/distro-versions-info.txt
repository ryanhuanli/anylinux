A note for next time we're updating the manylinux definitions:

Distrowatch has an amazing set of tables showing which versions of
which distros ship which libraries. So if you want to know the answer
to questions like "which versions of debian have a glibc that is newer
than the one in RHEL 7", then here you go:

https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat
https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=debian
https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=ubuntu

etc.
